# Mathtropolis

**Mathtropolis** is an alternative learning application designed to help young students (K-6) grow their math skills using fun, interactive, and different methods compared to conventional teaching. Most of the time, math is a subject kids tend to struggle and not have fun in, and my goal here is to help your child with that process. Please take the assessment (link at at the bottom of the home page) to be placed in a category based on your answers.

# To demo the app:

To the demo the app in its entirety, I have provided a guest account to login with to see the dashboard and courses. Please also take the assessment to see the full app. You will then be prompted to login once matched with a course. Here is the guest account details:

This application was made using the MERN stack (MySQL in this case vs MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The assessment/quiz was also made in React and I implmented other technologies such as Bootstrap, Chart.js for the dashboard, and JSON Web Tokens for the login and authentication system. The layout and design of this application was geared towards children with its bright colors and fun, easy to read fonts.
